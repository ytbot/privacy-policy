# YouTube Bot Privacy Policy
This privacy policy is here to help you understand what data and information we collect, why we collect it, and how you can manage, export or delete your information.

### Last modified: June 30, 2022

### Effective: August 18, 2020


## Agreement
By using any of our provided services you agree to comply with this privacy policy.


## Information we collect
We collect a small range of information that we use for analytical and functional purposes. This information is safely stored where only bot developers have access.

The information we collect for these purposes are but are not limited to:
- Your server's name and ID, your username and ID, and the times/dates that the bot joined your server (and left, if applicable)
- Cached versions of any data returned by the `YouTube v3 Data API` 

This information is stored in a password-protected, encrypted MongoDB instance, on a separate instance to the bot itself.

We also collect the following information on specific actions:
- If you vote for our bot on top.gg, we store your ID, the time/date, and whether the vote was done on the weekend
- If you use a command that fails for one or more reasons, including but not limited to: permission errors, YouTube and/or Google API errors, Discord API errors or errors originating from our own source code and implementations, we will log your ID, the time/date, the error that occurred, as well as the context, which includes the server and channel IDs if applicable.

### Why we collect information
We collect information to provide and run our bot and any associated services, to gain an insight into how our bot and services are used, to improve on the user experience, and to help develop new functionality or improve existing features.

### Who has access to your information
In all cases, only bot developers have direct, unfiltered access to your information. We take caution to make sure that all information is stored securely, and to make sure that no-one outside of the team has access to this information. We only store limited information in specific cases, as detailed above.

We share your information only with the following, authorized providers:
- **YouTube**: who maintains the `YouTube v3 Data API`, which the bot accesses frequently for requested information. We only pass on arguments or searches you provide - no information that can be used to identify you is provided
- **Google**: who maintains the YouTube PubSub service (publish and subscribe service), which we use to request and receive YouTube video upload notifications. We only pass on channel IDs that you or server admins (those with the Manage Server permission) have provided to us through the `/notify add` command - no information that can be used to identify you is provided

## How we host our services
All our services are hosted on a dedicated machine rented from: [WholesaleInternet](https://www.wholesaleinternet.net/)

All data stored on this machine is encrypted. Access to the data stored & services ran by `YouTube Bot` is restricted to BowsiePup.

All usage on the rented machine is subject to WholesaleInternet's [TOS](https://www.wholesaleinternet.net/terms-of-service/) & [Acceptable use Policy](https://www.wholesaleinternet.net/acceptable-use-policy/) 

## Updating, exporting and deleting your information
In the case that you would like to manage your information in a non-automated way, we offer ways for you to do so.

###  Updating your information
All of your information is infrequently modified once stored. Your ID never changes, as information is tied to your user account. We **do not** transfer user information from account to account.

You can modify limited information in the following ways:

- You can add or remove channel IDs from our notification service using the `/notify add` & `/notify list` commands
- You can add or remove custom messages that are used in conjunction with our notification service to send alerts using the `/notify list` command
- Information that has been automatically generated buy any of our provided services cannot be modified. We do not have a way to edit this information
- Any other information stored is not modifiable by bot developers or the user.

### Exporting your information
If you would like to request your information be exported and provided to you, please contact us using one of the methods provided at the end of the privacy policy. Exporting your information does not delete or modify it.

### Deleting your information
If you would like to request your information be deleted, please contact us using one of the methods provided at the end of the privacy policy.

Deleting your information does not export it and provide it to you by default - please specify if you would like your information exported and provided to you.

### Compliance
We ensure that our information policies, how we work with and handle your information, and how it is stored and collected complies with Discord's [TOS](https://discord.com/terms) and [Privacy Policy](https://discord.com/privacy), as well as the [Developer TOS](https://discord.com/developers/docs/policies-and-agreements/terms-of-service).

If you have any concerns over our privacy policy or our handling of your information, please contact us using one of the methods provided at the end of the privacy policy.

## When or where this policy applies
Our privacy policy applies whenever you use our bot or associated services in any way. This policy then covers the information collected, how we use and handle it, and how you can manage it.

It does not apply if you:
- are using another bot or service that we do not own, manage or are associated with in any way, shape or form, unless described separately;
- are using the Discord platform on it's own, not using our bot.
